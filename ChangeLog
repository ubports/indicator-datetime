	Removing a ref on the item

2011-02-07  karl-qdh  <karl@qdh.org.uk>

	Updated datetime service slightly to draw coloured dots for evolution colours, evolution is still slightly broken at doing it's part here and returns null colours.
	Updated configure.ac (hope this doesn't break merge), and added the radio menu item with a right aligned time to the indicator so we can have location/timezone entries.

2011-02-04  karl-qdh  <karl@qdh.org.uk>

	Added ESource Colours a circle drawn onto a cairo surface, however this code
	has one caveat, it's un-testable with evolution as evolutions color peek is
	currently broken. However I've used a very similar method of exchanging 
	GdkDrawables and cairo_surface_t before and it worked... Lets see this time :/

	Allowing more custom strings for formatting time and making sure they update correctly.

2010-12-23  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Add markup support to clock label
	
	This adds exactly the same markup support to the indicator-datetime
	label respect to the clock gnome panel applet.
	
	Now formats like the ones below can be correctly set:
	
	<span weight="Bold">%I:%M %p</span>
	<sup><span rise="3000" font_desc="ubuntu 7.5" color="#DFD8C8" weight="normal">%a %d %b</span></sup>%n<sub><span font_desc="ubuntu 7.5" color="#DFD8C8" weight="bold">%I:%M %p</span></sub>
	%a <b>%I:%M %p</b>

2010-12-23  Marco Trevisan (Treviño)  <mail@3v1n0.net>

	Reset the label max width when guessing it.
	
	This should reduce the indicator size when a smaller (custom) text has
	been added.

	Set label justification to center, and connect to "screen-changed" signal

	So now you can also put any custom string showing seconds, getting
	correctly updated.
